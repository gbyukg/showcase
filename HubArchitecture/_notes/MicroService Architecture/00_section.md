# The architecture of our demo Application

For this demo, Instead of using hub as our demo project in this showcase, I'm going to use a small but complete custom project as demo project, because Hub just started, there is no enough data and functionality to illustrate the whole infrastructor.

But no matter which project we are using, they are exactly the same.

So Let's take a quick preview of our demo application.

In order to have a more better understanding of our Docker Infrastructure, so firstly, I will gave you a brief description of this demo application. The demo application is a typical micro-service application. It was decomposed into three core microservices. All of them are independently deployable applications, organized around certain business domains.
